## AutoFill Arrays For Sublime Text

This plugin allows you to fill `Arrays` with lists of interesting/meaningful words by typing just a few keys. You have a choice to pick from several available categories. You could intuitively extend your lists as long as you want them to be. It works equally well in all mainstream programming languages, like `Python`, `Javascript`, `Java`, `C`, `C++`, `C#`, `Lua`, `Ruby`, etc. You could also use it with other array-like collection objects/types, like `List`, `Set`, `Tuple`, etc.


### Available Categories

`Flowers` `Fruits`   `Colors` `Birds`   `Animals` `Gems`   `Zodiac`
`Insects` `Fish`     `Food`   `Drinks`  `Months`  `Days`   `Vegetables`
`Planets` `Elements` `Metals` `Greeks`  `Romans`  `Trees`  `Seasons`
`Oceans`  `Seas`     `Rivers` `Languages`


### Examples

 Text Entered  |  Result
-------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------
 `floa`        | `"Rose", "Dahlia", "Magnolia", "Tulip", "Daisy"`
 `frua`        | `"Apple", "Mango", "Avocado", "Cherry", "Pomegranate"`

 `colp`        | `"Red", "Yellow", "Blue"`

### Tips

* Type only a few letters of the desired category. If you don't see Sublime Text's AutoComplete System responding to your typing, then you could activate it manually by pressing `ctrl + space`.

* Most categories comprise several short (5 elements) and long (>= 10 elements) lists. Explore them and incorporate them in your workflow accordingly.

* With a combination of few key-strokes, you could construct quite long lists within a matter of seconds.


### Installation

* Download the plugin (or clone this repository).
* After extraction, copy `autofill_arrays` folder to Sublime Text's _Packages_ folder.
* You can locate this folder from Sublime Text by using the menu command: _Preferences_ â†’ _Browse Packages_.
* You could start using this plugin straight away; no restart required.
